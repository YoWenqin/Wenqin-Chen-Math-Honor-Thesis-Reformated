You can easily make a copy of a classical bit. However, it is impossible to copy a qubit or any quantum state. Such phenomenon is known as the no cloning theorem and is another hallmark of quantum entanglement \cite{wootters1982single}. In other words, there exist no simple non-disturbing measurement scheme in the quantum world. 

\begin{theorem}[No Cloning Theorem] \label{no-cloning thm}
Arbitrary qubits (or quantum states), unlike classical bits, cannot be copied. 
\end{theorem} 

\begin{proof} \cite{Wehner:notes}
For contradiction, assume there exists such unitary operation C that can copy any arbitrary qubits $\ket{\psi_1}, \ket{\psi_2}$. Then
\begin{equation*}
    C(\ket{\psi_1} \otimes \ket{0})=\ket{\psi_1} \otimes \ket{\psi_1}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
C(\ket{\psi_2} \otimes \ket{0})=\ket{\psi_2} \otimes \ket{\psi_2}  
\end{equation*}
    

Since C is unitary, we have $C^\dagger C=\mathbb{I}$, so
\begin{eqnarray*}
\braket{\psi_1|\psi_2}&=&\braket{\psi_1|\psi_2}\braket{0|0}\\
&=&(\ket{\psi_1} \otimes \ket{0})(\ket{\psi_2} \otimes \ket{0})\\
&=&(\ket{\psi_1} \otimes \ket{0})C^\dagger C(\ket{\psi_2} \otimes \ket{0})\\
&=&(\bra{\psi_1} \otimes \bra{\psi_1})(\ket{\psi_2} \otimes \ket{\psi_2})\\
&=&(\braket{\psi_1 |\psi_2})^2
\end{eqnarray*}

So $\braket{\psi_1 | \psi_2}=0$ or $1$. So $\ket{\psi_1}$ and $\ket{\psi_2}$ are either equal or othorgonal. So we can only clone states which are orthogonal to one another, but cloning an arbitrary quantum state is impossible. 
\end{proof}
