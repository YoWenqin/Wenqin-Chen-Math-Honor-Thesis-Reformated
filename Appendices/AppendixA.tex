Postulate 3 can be completely restated in the context of projective measurements, which we present in the Appendix.




The measurement postulate for projective measurements is superficially rather different from the general postulate above.
\begin{quote}
    \textbf{Projective Measurements}: A projective measurement is described by an \textit{observable}, M, a Hermitian operator on the state space of the sytem being observed. The observable has a spectral decomposition,
    \begin{equation}
        M=\sum_m m P_m
    \end{equation}
    where $P_m$ is the projector onto the eigenspace of M with eigenvalue m \footnote{The eigenspace corresponding to an eigenvalue m is the set of vectors which have eigenvalue m}. The possible outcomes of the measurement correspond to the eigenvalues, m, of the observable. Upon measuring the state $\ket{\psi}$, the probability of getting result m is given by 
    \begin{equation} \label{eqn: projective measurement}
        p(m)=\braket{\psi|P_m|\psi}
    \end{equation}
    Given that outcome m occurred, the state of the quantum system immediately after the measurement is 
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{P_m \ket{\psi}}{\sqrt{p(m)}}.
    \end{equation}
\end{quote}

Here is an example of projective measurements on single qubits.
\begin{example}
Consider the Pauli-Z matrix introduced in \textbf{Example} \ref{example-pauli z diagonal rep}.
\begin{equation}
    Z=\ket{0}\bra{0}-\ket{1}\bra{1}
\end{equation}
Take Z as the observable for out projective measurement. Here $P_{+1}=\ket{0}\bra{0}$ is the projector onto the eigenspace of Z with eigenvalue 1. $P_{-1}=\ket{1}\bra{1}$ is the projector onto the eigenspace of Z with eigenvalue -1.

Thus the measurement of Z on the state $\ket{\psi}=\frac{\ket{0}+\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$ yields the outcome 1 with probability $\braket{\psi|0}\braket{0|\psi}=\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, the outcome -1 has probability $\frac{1}{2}$.
\end{example}

% Another feature that distinguishes quantum from classical is that that we can measure a qubit in basis aside from the standard basis. 





**********************************************************


Another very nice property of projective measurements is that it is very easy to calculate the expected value of a given the observable M of a projective measurement:
\begin{eqnarray}
E(M)&=&\sum_m mp(m)\\
&=&\sum_m m \braket{\psi|P_m|\psi}\\
&=&\braket{\psi|(\sum_m mP_m)|\psi}\\
&=&\braket{\psi|M|\psi}
\end{eqnarray}
