\textcolor{blue}{I added some possible things in no particular order}

\begin{itemize}
\item Replacing pure states by mixed states in the classification of entanglement computation.
\item Explicit computation on "general case" of maximally entangled states whose coordinate matrices are not scalar multiples of unitary matrices with a "randomly" selected basis.
\item Probability that a randomly selected maximally entangled state has a coordinate matrix that is a scalar multiple of a unitary matrix.
\item Anything about the entanglement "decaying".
\end{itemize}
