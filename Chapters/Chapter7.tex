\textcolor{blue}{I added some possible things in no particular order}

\begin{itemize}
\item Replacing pure states by mixed states in the classification of entanglement computation.
\item Explicit computation on "general case" of maximally entangled states whose coordinate matrices are not scalar multiples of unitary matrices with a "randomly" selected basis.
\item Probability that a randomly selected maximally entangled state has a coordinate matrix that is a scalar multiple of a unitary matrix.
\item Anything about the entanglement "decaying".
\end{itemize}

\section{Projective Measurement vs POVM}

\section{Statistic Test}
- if there's an analog to the standard basis and the hadarmard basis with respect to the singlet state as in bb84 and e91. if this is true, our protocol can be strengthed with the statistic test and  generalize bb84 and e91

this thesis gives rise to more questions that can be written down. so i just give out two of them. each should be in one paragraph.
